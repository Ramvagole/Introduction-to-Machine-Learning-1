    "In machine learning, the process of training a model involves dividing the available dataset into three separate sets: the training set, the validation set, and the test set. Here's an explanation of each split and their importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Training Set:\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The training set is a subset of the dataset used to train the machine learning model. It consists of input data (features) and their corresponding output labels or target values (in supervised learning).\n",
    "Importance: The training set is crucial for the model to learn the patterns and relationships in the data. During training, the model adjusts its parameters or weights based on the provided input-output pairs to minimize the prediction error. The larger and more diverse the training set, the better the model can learn and generalize to unseen data.\n",

By evaluating the model's performance on the validation set, different hyperparameter configurations can be tested, and the best-performing model can be selected. The validation set acts as a proxy for measuring the model's performance on unseen data and helps in preventing overfitting (when the model becomes too specialized in the training data).\n",
    "Test Set:\n",

    "Definition: The test set is another independent subset of the dataset that is used to assess the final performance and generalization ability of the trained model.\n",
    "Importance: The test set provides an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data. It helps to assess how well the model can generalize and make accurate predictions on new, unseen examples. By using a separate test set, it is possible to estimate the model's performance in real-world scenarios accurately. The test set should only be used after the model has been fully trained and fine-tuned based on the validation set."
